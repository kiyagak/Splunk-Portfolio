## Objective

The goal is to get AWS S3 data using the following steps:

- Create s3 bucket in aws
- Create Access key and Secret Access keys in AWS
- Login in to splunk web
- Create a new index to capture data in splunk
- Go to Apps â€” Find more Apps = Install AWS Add-on on splunk
  - Open App
- Add Account with Aws credentials
- Click on Create New Input > Custom Data Type > Generic S3
- Fill all the required fields and click on save
- Verify inputs has been created.
- Upload any csv file on s3 bucket.

## Notes

friend A needs to get parsel or champagne from friend B's house

they need
    address 
    access to house via key or biometrics
once they have these 2 things they can get the parsel/champagne bottle
    
    
for Splunk to pull data from S3 bucket it needs
    address tells Splunk where to fetch data = AWS cloud platform
    a key gives Splunk access to go inside AWS and fetch the data from S3 bucket
        S3 bucket works as storage drive
        
why not ingest data directly?
    putting in a drive one after another will make Splunk ingesting or pull it from AWS

cant ingest data for a file exceeding 500MB
only files/data at a max file size of 500MB can be ingested

  - I am only proceeding using this method for the sake of following and demonstrating steps shown in the Splunk Bootcamp
- Click **Create access key**
